Hi every one this is my first machine learning model.
the data of the model is downloaded from kaggle platform,
by providing the information model will predict whether the person have Cardiovascular Disease or not
in this model there are 12 features including 1 labels column.
70,000 raws data is used in whole model 20% in for training means 14,000 for testing and remain 56,000 for training,
